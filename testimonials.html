      <p class="message">Jess is amazing we would really recommend her to anyone. She struck up an
        instant bond with my son when studying for the 11+. Trying to get a 10/11 year old boy to
        study after school is not an easy task but her approach to learning and encouragement to my
        son really brought out the best in him. Jess provides very informative and detailed feedback
        after each session and was constantly adjusting the next session depending on our needs and
        the direction she felt was needed.
        5 star tutor!</p>

      <p class="message">Jess is the most wonderful tutor. She is excellent at tailoring her
        teaching style to the needs of your child and she provides feedback after every session so
        you can review progress and areas for improvement. Not only has my daughter improved across
        all the core subjects, but also in her confidence and self belief; the results have been
        staggering. I only wish we could take Jess with us on our move!!</p>

      <p class="message">Highly recommend Tidworth Tutoring. My daughter (year 2) was really
        struggling with her handwriting and general confidence with reading/writing. After a term
        with Jess (3 sessions a week), her writing is lovely, she wants to read on her own but more
        importantly her confidence has soared. She adores Jess and runs, skips and jumps into her
        tutoring sessions. Jess tailors each session for your child, considers their likes and
        dislikes. She even wrote letters from the fairies to get Issy’s imagination running wild!
        Issy especially liked the shaving foam writing sessions . I cannot thank her enough for
        unlocking Issy’s potential.</p>
