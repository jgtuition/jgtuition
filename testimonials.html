      <p class="message">Jess has been tutoring my daughter in preparation for  English GCSE for the past year. Jess's dedication and expertise have been exceptional. My daughter's grades have significantly improved, and her confidence in the subject has grown immensely. Jess's patient and tailored approach has made learning enjoyable and effective. We couldn't be more pleased with the positive outcome and the remarkable progress my daughter has achieved. Jess is an outstanding tutor, and we highly recommend her services.</p>

      <p class="message">Jess has been an exceptional tutor for our son for nearly 2 years now. We consider ourselves incredibly fortunate to have found Jess just as our son began preparing for the 7+ exam that summer. For a child as young as 6, the journey towards exams can be quite challenging. However, it quickly became evident that our son thoroughly enjoyed every session with Jess and was eager to have more lessons! Under Jess’s guidance, we witnessed remarkable progress in both English and Maths and he eventually was successful in the exams for prestigious schools. What's more, we were delighted when he expressed a strong desire to continue learning from Jess even after the 7+ exam. Since then, we have been enjoying the time with Jess.  Jess is a genuinely warm and inspiring individual. Her wit and encouragement have been instrumental whilst she yet identifies areas for improvement for him.</p>

      <p class="message">Jess has been supporting my son in year 4 with his literacy and reading. He found writing and reading very challenging and had no confidence at all. From our first session, Jess had a very calm and nurturing manner which immediately made my son feel comfortable and excited about his tuition. In her initial assessment she was able to identify any gaps in his phonological knowledge and planned her sessions specifically for his needs. She also listened to his interests and each task was linked to that creating exciting and fun sessions. Jess provides excellent feedback that is so useful and informative - it shows what they have done in each session, my son’s engagement and the next steps. It is also a fantastic record to see his progress over the last 6 months. It has been wonderful to see my son's confidence return with his writing and I love hearing about all the stories and descriptive characters he has been creating with Jess. From Greek myths and gods, adventurous bear chases, to alternative fairy tales - he comes out of each session so proud of his work. From a very reluctant writer he is now so enthusiastic and I can't thank Jess enough for instilling a love of reading and writing into my son.  Jess is a fantastic tutor that I would highly recommend to anyone and I'm extremely grateful for all her support.</p>

      <p class="message">Jess has been tutoring my son for 2 years and he has come on in leaps and bounds. He required help with his handwriting as well as English. His confidence has grown and he enjoys having the tutor sessions with Jess in person. His school have noticed a huge change in not only his attitude to learning but also his work. My son finds learning with Jess a great help and says her explanations, doing the work, summarising the work all helps him. My son says Jess is kind and patient when tutoring him. With GCSE’s coming up we are continuing with Jess’s tutorials. We would thoroughly recommend her to any parents who want additional and thoughtful tuition. </p>

      <p class="message">Jess has taught my son (aged 10) for the last 18 months, focusing on spellings and handwriting. He has made huge progress during his time with her and he no longer needs any additional support at school!  He enjoys her lessons and always looks forward to seeing her.  </p>

      <p class="message">Jess is the most wonderful tutor and I would highly recommend her.  Jess has tutored our daughter Bea for the past year, helping her prep for the 11 + exam. Not only has Bea gained knowledge, learned strategies and techniques, coming on leaps and bounds in the areas she struggles with, but we have also seen a huge boost in Bea’s confidence both at school and in herself, which has been great to see. Jess’s approach is gentle and kind, yet progressive and we are very grateful for everything she has done for Bea. </p>

      <p class="message">Jess is amazing we would really recommend her to anyone. She struck up an
        instant bond with my son when studying for the 11+. Trying to get a 10/11 year old boy to
        study after school is not an easy task but her approach to learning and encouragement to my
        son really brought out the best in him. Jess provides very informative and detailed feedback
        after each session and was constantly adjusting the next session depending on our needs and
        the direction she felt was needed.
        5 star tutor!</p>

      <p class="message">Jess is the most wonderful tutor. She is excellent at tailoring her
        teaching style to the needs of your child and she provides feedback after every session so
        you can review progress and areas for improvement. Not only has my daughter improved across
        all the core subjects, but also in her confidence and self belief; the results have been
        staggering. I only wish we could take Jess with us on our move!!</p>

      <p class="message">Highly recommend Tidworth Tutoring. My daughter (year 2) was really
        struggling with her handwriting and general confidence with reading/writing. After a term
        with Jess (3 sessions a week), her writing is lovely, she wants to read on her own but more
        importantly her confidence has soared. She adores Jess and runs, skips and jumps into her
        tutoring sessions. Jess tailors each session for your child, considers their likes and
        dislikes. She even wrote letters from the fairies to get Issy’s imagination running wild!
        Issy especially liked the shaving foam writing sessions . I cannot thank her enough for
        unlocking Issy’s potential.</p>

      <p class="message"> Jess is a remarkable and inspirational teacher who helped our child excel
        and makes learning fun!
        <br>
        Beginning with a personalised assessment, Jess’s tuition was then carefully tailored to our
        child’s specific needs. Using a variety of teaching resources and learning styles, our child
        raced ahead in literacy, numeracy and handwriting. And Jess has a wonderful manner and
        rapport with our little one that has made her a mentor and role model for our child. All of
        this is delivered in an inspirational and exciting way that makes learning *fun*! As a
        result our little one’s favourite after school activity is- more lessons! (Only with Jess of
        course).
        <br>
        We feel so lucky to have found Jess and couldn’t recommend her teaching more highly. Thank
        you Jess!

      <p class="message"> Jess has been tutoring our son who is 6 for about 3 months now. Jess is
        wonderful! Stanley absolutely loves going each week and has come on leaps and bounds. He has
        grown so much in confidence, and knows that if there’s anything in class he finds tricky he
        can talk to Jess about it and they can go through it together. Jess has an amazing way of
        keeping children engaged and really understanding each unique child and what interests them
        (and also knows when it’s time for a “brain break”!) She is full of creativity, smiles and
        warmth and we just love her!
        <br>
        The communication between Jess and us as parents is outstanding, the after-session emails
        allow us to see what Stanley has done, how he got on performance wise and what the next
        steps are in his learning so it really helps us feel informed as parents and part of the
        learning journey.
        <br>
        We highly recommend Jess to any parent looking for a little bit of extra support for their
        child! She’s fab!

      <p class="message">I would recommend Jess as an 11+ tutor to anyone. She was extremely
        thorough in her assessments and the sessions were completely personalised towards my
        daughter’s individual strengths and the areas she found more challenging. Jess managed to
        get the balance right; making the sessions enjoyable for my daughter, whilst still ensuring
        she understood the long-term aim! We noticed an improvement in Florence’s class work,
        particularly her maths very quickly. As a parent, I was given plenty of really helpful
        feedback and things to work on at home each week. We can’t speak more highly of Jess’
        tutoring, she was brilliant with our daughter.

      <p class="message"> Our five year old adored her sessions with Jess. Within a few weeks, we
        noticed a huge improvement in her handwriting. She could form all letters correctly and was
        beginning to join, having had very few decipherable letters when she started. Our daughter’s
        teachers at school all commented on how much progress she had made in such a short time.
        Jess made the sessions great fun for our daughter with funky pens, stickers and shaving
        foam! She absolutely loved it and was always really keen to go. Could not recommend Jess as
        a tutor enough!

      <p class="message"> Jess has been giving our daughter tuition on maths for the last couple of
        months. She met our daughter face to face initially and then gave us an idea of where she
        could help. She always makes the lessons fun, creates a really positive environment, even
        though she is online, and gives great and immediate written feedback after every lesson so
        we can see how our daughter is progressing and where there needs to be additional focus. Our
        daughter really looks forward to and enjoys lessons with Jess and we would thoroughly
        recommend her to any parents who want additional and thoughtful tuition.

      <p class="message"> Jess’s tuition has really helped our children a lot with their studies.
        How she took time in the beginning to evaluate their understanding of Maths and English and
        then built the teaching programme to better suit them really made the difference. They
        always looked forward to their tuition as they felt comfortable and enjoyed learning with
        Jess. Thanks ever so much for your contribution towards their learning.
