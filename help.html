    <h3 style="font-family: 'Oswald', serif; font-size: 1.5em;">I offer a variety of sessions:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Regular one-to-one tuition</b> – “Little and often” is an approach I believe works
          best
          for
          much
          of the Primary curriculum. Regular sessions can cover a variety of topics with
          opportunities
          to regularly review and recap previous learning. These sessions can also go hand in hand
          with
          what is being taught at school so that your child gets the most from their time in the
          classroom. A mix of subjects is often taught in these sessions.</li><br>

        <li><b>Boosters</b> – these are sessions concentrated over a short period of time (often a
          school
          holiday but they can be held during term time). Boosters are designed to top up existing
          learning. They are particularly effective for learning and reinforcing topics such as
          handwriting or times tables. Boosters are also a great way to build confidence in a
          particular
          subject or topic that hasn’t clicked yet.</li><br>
        <li><b>11 Plus / Entrance Examinations</b>– Tailored specifically to the entrance
          examinations
          your
          child will be taking, this tuition covers Maths, English, Verbal and Non-Verbal reasoning.
          Presentation and interview skills can also be covered if required.</li><br>
          <li><b>GCSE support</b>– Bespoke tuition for GCSE English Literature and GCSE English Language exams.</li><br>
          <li><b>Online or in-person tuition.</b</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I tailor everything I do to your child’s specific needs and because my sessions are private,
        your child will benefit from a truly bespoke package of support. <br><br> Most sessions are
        1
        hour long, but this can be adjusted to fit in with what your child will respond to most
        positively. All my tutoring is done from my home. Tuition is available during term time and school holidays.
        I provide all resources your child will need.<br><br> </p>
      <h3 style="font-family: 'Oswald', serif; font-size: 1.5em;">Initial assessment:</h3>
      <p> I will meet your child and get to know them and their needs through
        a
        relaxed assessment session. This first session is free of charge. It gives your child a
        chance
        to get to know me and helps me to create a learning plan for them. </p>
      <h3 style="font-family: 'Oswald', serif; font-size: 1.5em;">Feedback:</h3>
      <p>After every session
        with me, I will provide you with a written summary of what work
        we have covered and how your child has got on during their tuition.
