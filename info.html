    <h2>Payment Information</h2>
    <p>The first session is free.  If you are happy to continue with tuition after the initial session, I will issue an invoice in advance of the first session of each   month.  
      Payment is due monthly, in advance, by bank transfer. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <p>Please notify me as soon as possible if a session has to be cancelled.  Ideally, I would like 24 hours notice, but I appreciate with young children, this may not always be possible.
    Please be prompt with drop off and pick up. I cannot guarantee a full lesson if you are late.
    No-shows will incur the full fee.
    When I have to cancel a session, I will do my best to re-arrange an alternative time.
    </p>
    <h2>Lesson Requirements </h2>
    <p>Students do not need to bring any stationery.  All resources will be provided.  
    Depending on needs, students may need to bring school spelling lists or reading books.  This will be communicated in advance.
    </p>
    <h2>Progress Updates</h2>
    <p>Short anecdotal updates on progress and performance will be given at the end of each session.  A written summary of work covered and next steps will be sent out after each lesson.  
    </p>
    <h2>Behaviour</h2>
    <p>Tuition takes place in my home.  Respect for people, property and belongings is always expected.  Disruptive or destructive behaviour will result in the tuition being cancelled with immediate effect.  
    </p>
    <h2>Complaints</h2>
    <p>It is important that you are happy with the service I provide.  In the unlikely event that you are unhappy with the tuition service provided at any point, please call or email me (Jessica Geary) as soon as an issue arises and I will attempt to resolve it. 
    </p>
    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>I work hard to ensure all my students make satisfactory progress but this cannot be guaranteed, and I cannot be held accountable for the academic success or otherwise of the student. 
      <br><br>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, I will not accept liability for any direct or indirect loss or damage, foreseeable or otherwise, including any indirect, consequential, special or exemplary damages arising from the use of my tuition services or any errors or omissions in the content of my learning materials.
