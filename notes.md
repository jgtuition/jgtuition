Sub-heading / summary of what I do:  
One-to-one tuition, tailored specifically to your child’s needs.  

##Home:
I am a fully qualified and experienced primary school teacher.  I offer private tuition to primary-aged children to support the following areas:
Maths
Reading
Writing
Handwriting

##Who I am:
Having worked as a Class Teacher and also as a special needs Teaching Assistant, I have over 8 years of experience in the classroom and as a tutor.    I have built a large amount of experience supporting children with their education needs and I enjoy seeing them grow in both confidence and ability.
I take pride in creating a learning environment that will bring out the best in every child I work with.  

##What I do:
I tailor everything I do to your child’s specific needs and because my sessions are private, your child will benefit from a truly bespoke package of support.  Most sessions are 1 hour long, but this can be adjusted to fit in with what your child will respond to most positively.
Initial assessment: I will meet your child and get to know them and their needs through a relaxed assessment session.  This first session is free of charge.  It gives your child a chance to get to know me and helps me to create a learning plan for them.
Feedback:  After every session with me, I will provide you with a written summary of what work we have covered and how your child has got on during their tuition.
Whether it’s filling gaps in learning, preparing for examinations or just building confidence, tuition can benefit children in many ways.  I offer a variety of sessions:

    • Regular one-to-one tuition – “Little and often” is an approach I believe works best for much of the Primary curriculum.  Regular sessions can cover a variety of topics with opportunities to regularly review and recap previous learning.  These sessions can also go hand in hand with what is being taught at school so that your child gets the most from their time in the classroom.  A mix of subjects is often taught in these sessions.

    • Boosters – these are sessions concentrated over a short period of time (often a school holiday but they can be held during term time).  Boosters are designed to top up existing learning.  They are particularly effective for learning and reinforcing topics such as handwriting or times tables.  Boosters are also a great way to build confidence in a particular subject or topic that hasn’t clicked yet.

    • 11 Plus / Entrance Examinations– Tailored specifically to the entrance examinations your child will be taking, this tuition covers Maths, English, Verbal and Non-Verbal reasoning.   Presentation and interview skills can also be covered if required.

##Where and when:
I tutor from my home.  Tuition is available on school days (both term time and during school holidays), between 3.30pm and 7pm.
I provide all resources your child will need.

##Why tuition may help:
Tuition is often seen as something done in preparation for exams or tests but over recent years, I’ve seen for myself how it can benefit children at all stages of their education.   Learning a different approach, hearing a different voice or just spending a bit more time practising a particular skill can boost what is being learnt in the classroom.  Because my sessions are private, I work at a pace that suits your child and they can ask as many questions as they like!  
Most recently, I’ve seen the gaps in children’s learning as a result of lockdowns and I’ve loved being able to help my students build their knowledge and gain confidence.

##Reviews:
Jess is amazing we would really recommend her to anyone. She struck up an instant bond with my son when studying for the 11+. Trying to get a 10/11 year old boy to study after school is not an easy task but her approach to learning and encouragement to my son really brought out the best in him. Jess provides very informative and detailed feedback after each session and was constantly adjusting the next session depending on our needs and the direction she felt was needed.

Jess is the most wonderful tutor. She is excellent at tailoring her teaching style to the needs of your child and she provides feedback after every session so you can review progress and areas for improvement. Not only has my daughter improved across all the core subjects, but also in her confidence and self belief; the results have been staggering. I only wish we could take Jess with us on our move!!

Highly recommend Tidworth Tutoring. My daughter (year 2) was really struggling with her handwriting and general confidence with reading/writing. After a term with Jess (3 sessions a week), her writing is lovely, she wants to read on her own but more importantly her confidence has soared. She adores Jess and runs, skips and jumps into her tutoring sessions. Jess tailors each session for your child, considers their likes and dislikes. She even wrote letters from the fairies to get Issy’s imagination running wild! Issy especially liked the shaving foam writing sessions . I cannot thank her enough for unlocking Issy’s potential.

Intro video
I’ve emailed the video separately but I was  wondering if you can edit out the sentence where I say I’m based in Tidworth?
Don’t worry if you can’t, I can re-record it.
