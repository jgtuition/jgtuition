      <p>
        I am a fully qualified and experienced primary school teacher. I offer private tuition to
        primary-aged children to support the following areas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maths</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Writing</li>
        <li>Handwriting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Having worked as a Class Teacher and also as a Learning Support Teaching Assistant, I have
        over 8 years of experience in the classroom and as a tutor. <br><br> I have built a large
        amount of experience supporting children with their education needs and I enjoy seeing them
        grow in both confidence and ability. <br><br>
        I take pride in creating a learning environment that will bring out the best in every child
        I work with. I am DBS checked.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h2 style="font-family: 'Oswald', serif; font-size: 2em;">My Work</h2>
      <p>
        Tuition is often seen as something done in preparation for exams or tests but over recent
        years, I’ve seen for myself how it can benefit children at all stages of their
        education.<br><br>
        Learning a different approach, hearing a different voice or just spending a bit more time
        practising a particular skill can boost what is being learnt in the classroom.<br><br>
        Because
        my
        sessions are private, I work at a pace that suits your child and they can ask as many
        questions as they like!<br><br>
        Most recently, I’ve seen the gaps in children’s learning as a result of lockdowns and I’ve
        loved being able to help my students build their knowledge and gain confidence.
